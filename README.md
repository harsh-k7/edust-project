🚮 EDUST – Smart Waste Management Bins
📌 Overview

EDUST is an IoT-enabled smart waste management system designed to tackle urban waste collection problems. Our bins detect fill levels, compact waste, eliminate odors, and send real-time data to municipal dashboards.

With EDUST, cities can achieve cleaner streets, optimized waste collection, reduced costs, and improved sustainability.

🌍 Problem Statement

Overflowing dustbins create unhygienic conditions in cities.

Manual waste collection is inefficient and costly.

Lack of real-time monitoring leads to delays in cleaning.

Odor and unmanaged waste affect public health and environment.

💡 Our Solution – EDUST

EDUST introduces Smart Waste Bins powered by IoT + Cloud:

📊 Fill Level Detection → Ultrasonic sensors detect how full the bin is.

⚙️ Compaction → Motorized system compresses waste to store more.

🌬️ Odor Control → Carbon + HEPA filter removes foul smells.

📡 IoT Connectivity → ESP32 + GSM/LoRa sends data to cloud dashboards.

🔋 Power Supply → Solar-powered for streets, 12V adapter for homes.

📱 User & Municipal Dashboard → Web app for real-time monitoring.

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔌 Hardware

ESP32 Microcontroller → Core IoT brain of the system.

Ultrasonic Sensor → Detects fill level of the bin.

Load Cell → Measures weight of collected waste.

Moisture Sensor → Detects wet vs. dry waste.

DC Motor + Compactor → Compresses waste.

Carbon + HEPA Filter → Removes odor.

Power → Solar panel + battery (public) / 12V adapter (home).

☁️ Software & Cloud

Blynk / ThingSpeak / Firebase → IoT cloud platform for data storage.

Web Dashboard (React + Node.js) → Real-time waste monitoring.

Data Analytics → Predictive collection schedules for municipalities.

⚙️ Working Flow

Waste is thrown into the bin.

Sensors detect fill level, weight, and moisture.

If waste exceeds threshold → motor compresses trash.

ESP32 sends data to cloud platform (Blynk/Firebase/ThingSpeak).

Municipal dashboard shows:

Fill status (Empty / Half / Full)

Location of bin

Collection alerts

Data is analyzed to optimize collection routes.

📊 Revenue Model

EDUST will generate revenue through:

Hardware Sales → Selling smart bins to municipalities, societies, corporates.

SaaS Subscription → Charging cities for the cloud dashboard & analytics.

Maintenance Services → Regular filter replacements & technical support.

Data Insights → Selling anonymized waste data for sustainability research.

🚀 Benefits

✅ Cleaner streets & better public hygiene.
✅ Reduced municipal costs (optimized routes & collection).
✅ Longer bin usage with waste compaction.
✅ Eco-friendly (solar powered, odor-free).
✅ Scalable to both public and home use.

📌 Future Roadmap

✅ Prototype → Ultrasonic sensor + ESP32 (working demo).

🔜 Pilot Project → Small-scale deployment in societies/colleges.

🔜 Partnerships → Municipalities, Smart City projects, NGOs.

🔜 AI Integration → Image recognition for automatic waste segregation.

🔜 Scaling → Nationwide adoption, smart city networks.



🏆 Impact & Vision

EDUST aims to create sustainable, smart, and clean cities.
Our vision is to deploy millions of smart bins across India and beyond, making waste collection efficient, transparent, and eco-friendly.
